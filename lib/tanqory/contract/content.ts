/**
 * The content-tree contract: what a `templates/<slug>.json` may contain, and

 *
 * Node identity is the part that was never written down, and it is the part the
 * round trip depends on. Today:
 *
 *   - The Editor mints `${type}_${uuid8}` (`tanqory-template-context.tsx:379`)
 *     — stable and unique. Correct.
 *   - `blocksToStudio` (`editor-routes.mjs:49-62`) falls back to
 *     `` `${b.type}-${i}` `` for a block with no id — a POSITIONAL identity.
 *     Reorder the array on disk and `faq-item-0` now means a different question.
 *   - `themekitToStudio` falls back to `s.id ?? s.type` for a section — so two
 *     sections of the same type with no id COLLIDE in the `sections` map and the
 *     second silently overwrites the first.
 *
 * Both fallbacks are silent. Neither is safe for "AI edits one answer without
 * clobbering the others", which is exactly what this contract has to make true.
 * The rule below is therefore: **every node carries an explicit, stable id.**
