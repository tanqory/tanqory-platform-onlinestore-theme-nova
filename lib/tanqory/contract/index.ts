/**
 * Tanqory Theme Contract v1 — the shared agreement between the theme (kit),
 * the CMS (studio-api + code-store), the Editor (studio-app), the storefront
 * runtime, and any AI authoring against them.
 *
 * Owner: `@tanqory/theme-kit`. It already owns `AttrSpec` / `SectionDef` /
 * `ContentNode` / `PageDoc`, so the contract derives from the code rather than
 * restating it — and `tsc` proves the derivation.
 *
 * This entry is dependency-free (no React), so it builds to a single portable
 * `dist/contract.js` that studio-api can vendor without breaking its
 * zero-npm-dependency image.
